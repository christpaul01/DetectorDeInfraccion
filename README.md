This project is a Django-based system for detecting traffic violations using YOLOv8 and OpenCV. It processes video streams from registered cameras, identifies vehicles, and detects when they cross from allowed regions (ROIs Normales) into restricted areas (ROIs Prohibidos). When a violation is detected, the system captures the vehicleâ€™s image, encodes it in base64, and stores it in the database. The project also includes user role management, camera configuration, and a video streaming feature optimized for real-time processing.
